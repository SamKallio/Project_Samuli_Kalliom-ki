# About this project

This project was made for "CT30A3204 Advanced Web Applications" course taught by LUT. It is site where user can post posts, comments and likes. It was made using:

React, ExpressJs, NodeJs, Materialize, MongoDB

Among few other packages which can be found from package.json files under "dependencies" categories.

## Technology Choices

To be completely honest, they were all I knew about. I did not have time to look into much "extra" so to speak, working full time and managing the course took everything. So I went with the technologies that were introduced during the course.

So to answer the question: There was not a "expert" idea why I chose anything. I chose what I knew best at this point.

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.
